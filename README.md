# Decorate the forest

Author: Yilin Wang

Design: My game use water bucket to water the ground and new trees will be spawn from the watered location. In this way, the forest is no longer treeless.

How To Play: Use the arrow key to locate the water bucket and press space to water that part of the ground. Then a tree will be spawned at that palce. You at most can plant 5 trees. The goal is to plant more trees in the forest.
